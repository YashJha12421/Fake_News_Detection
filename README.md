# Fake_News_Detection
An ML model which predicts whether a news article is real or fake, along with a web app implemented using Flask




# 📝 Fake/Real News Classification Web App

A simple machine learning web app for text classification, built with Flask/Streamlit, trained using scikit-learn on Kaggle.
This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, saving with `pickle`, and deploying an interactive web app.



## 🚀 Features

* Preprocesses text using **NLTK** (stopword removal, lemmatization, etc.)
* ML models trained on Kaggle (`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`)
* Interactive **web app** using Flask/Streamlit
* Simple, lightweight UI to input text and see predictions

## 📊 Model Training

* Dataset and training were handled in **Kaggle Notebooks**.

* Preprocessing steps include:

  * Lowercasing
  * Stopword removal
  * Lemmatization

* Models used: `XGBoost`, random forest' `Logistic Regression`

* Final model exported as `model.pkl` and loaded in the web app.

Do you want me to also **include visuals (accuracy chart, confusion matrix, word cloud, etc.)** in the README itself, or keep them only in your **Kaggle notebook** and just reference them in the README?
